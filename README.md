Talos CI is a webhook based application that is mainly focused on providing some extensions to existing platforms and automation for some events. 
Because of its high modularity, every use case is a plugin. You can choose one of the existing plugins:

- [talos-welcome](https://github.com/aspartame21/talos-welcome)
- [talos-blunderbuss](https://github.com/aspartame21/talos-blunderbuss)
- [talos-testrunner](https://github.com/aspartame21/talos-testrunner)
- [talos-lgtm](https://github.com/aspartame21/talos-lgtm)
- [talos-approve](https://github.com/aspartame21/talos-approve)
- [talos-caturday](https://github.com/aspartame21/talos-caturday)

Or you can implement functionality for your business needs by writing your plugin. For such case you can start from forking [talos-plugin-boilerplate](https://github.com/aspartame21/talos-plugin-boilerplate).
